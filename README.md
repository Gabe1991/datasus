## Introduction

This project is a collection of R scripts to create an interface to the Public Healthcare Data repositories made available by the Brazil's Ministry of Health. The government agency responsible for publishing this data is called [DATASUS](http://datasus.saude.gov.br/), hence the name of the collection.

My motivation for this project is pretty much summarized by this article: http://simplystatistics.org/2016/04/20/data-repositories/

This project's current status is **Work in Progress (WIP)**. If you have any questions, suggestions and improvement requests, please feel free to contact me and I'll do my best to reply.
